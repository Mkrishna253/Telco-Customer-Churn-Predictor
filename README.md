# 🚨 Telco Customer Churn Predictor

This repository presents a comprehensive machine learning pipeline for predicting telecom customer churn using customer profiles, usage patterns, and billing data. The project demonstrates best practices in data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation, with a focus on actionable business insights.

## ✨ Features
- Complete workflow from raw data to model evaluation
- Automated data preprocessing, encoding, and scaling
- Imbalanced data handling (SMOTE / class weights)
- Multiple machine learning models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost
- Visualizations: class distribution, feature importance
- Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, F1-score, ROC-AUC

## 📝 Problem Statement
Customer churn leads to significant revenue loss for telecom companies. This project aims to automate the identification of high-risk customers and highlight key churn factors, enabling proactive retention strategies and improved business outcomes.
